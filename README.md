This C# program is an upgraded version of my [DeviPackUnpackTool](https://github.com/Surihix/DeviPackUnpackToolFW) that allows you to make an archive file with a filelist, for a folder that contains a lot of files and sub folders. the files can optionally be compressed with zlib compression, when it is being packed into the archive file.

The generated archive file and the filelist will have the same name of the folder that was packed along with a .deviarc and .devilist as the file extensions.

Please launch the program with '-h' or '-?' switches to know more about the functions.
